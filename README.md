# Teminology Hack 02/10/2019

This is a very simple app created as part of NHS Terminology Connectathon 02/10/2019.

It allows you to search for a snomed term and view any associated synonyms for that term.

The application is written using the following stack.

* Vue.js (version XX) - Core JS library for creating single page apps
* Vuetify (version 2.x) - UI component framework for visual aspects
* Axios - data retrieval
* VUEX for state management (but only for errors)
* Vue Router for page navigation (but only used for about screen)

There are no unit tests!
